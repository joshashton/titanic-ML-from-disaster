# Titanic ML from disaster
This notebook shows my submission to the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)

Current prediction score = 0.74401

## Description

The aim is to produce a machine learning model that correctly predicts who survived the Titanic disaster

In the jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline
